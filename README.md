JavaScript Exercises
====================

A collection of JavaScript exercises that will grow over time. They aim to
cover commonly used JavaScript components such as image galleries, carousels, tabbed navigation etc. These should ideally be built initially without the
assistance of libraries and then reimplemented to see the differences.

The idea is to allow people to learn practical JavaScript skills in their
own time which they can then take and use in their own projects.

They're designed to work with student/mentor pairs. The student completes
an exercise and sends it to the mentor to be reviewed. This would ideally
be done in person but a tool such as GitHub Pull Requests might be enough.

After the review the student should update the code with any recommendations
before moving on to the next exercise.
