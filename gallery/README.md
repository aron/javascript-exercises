Image Gallery Exercise
======================

A progressively enhanced JavaScript image gallery. The base markup provides
a single full size image and an unordered list of thumbnail links pointing to
their full size counterparts.

There are no rules for completing the exercise but we encourage you to try
them using plain JavaScript first then again with a library to understand
the difference.

Step 1
------

When the user clicks on a thumbnail its full size representation should
replace the current full size image in the gallery.
